# Markdown Basics: A Quick Guide

Markdown is a lightweight markup language with plain text formatting syntax. It's designed to be easy to read and write, and can be quickly converted to HTML or other formats.  It's widely used for documentation, README files, and online content.


## Headings

Headings are denoted by using `#` symbols. The number of `#` symbols corresponds to the heading level.  For example:

`# Heading 1`
`## Heading 2`
`### Heading 3`

## Bold and Italics

To make text **bold**, enclose it in double asterisks (`**`). To make text *italic*, enclose it in single asterisks (`*`).

Example:  This is **bold** text and *this is italic* text.

## Lists

Markdown supports both ordered and unordered lists.

### Unordered List

Use `*`, `-`, or `+` to create an unordered list:

* Item 1
* Item 2
* Item 3

### Ordered List

Use numbers followed by a period to create an ordered list:

1. First item
2. Second item
3. Third item

## Links and Images

You can create hyperlinks using square brackets `[]` for the link text and parentheses `()` for the URL.

`[Google](https://www.google.com)`

You can embed images using a similar syntax:

`![Alt text](image_url.jpg)`

## Code

To display inline code, enclose it in single backticks (`).  For multi-line code blocks, use triple backticks (```) followed by the language name.

`print("Hello, world!")`

```python
def greet(name):
  print(f"Hello, {name}!")

greet("World")
```

## Blockquotes

Use the `>` symbol to create a blockquote.

> This is a blockquote. It's often used to highlight important text or provide citations.

## Horizontal Rule

You can create a horizontal rule using three or more hyphens (`---`), asterisks (`***`), or underscores (`___`).
