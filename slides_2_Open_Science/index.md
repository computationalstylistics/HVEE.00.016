## topics covered today


- reproducibility
- Open Science
- FAIR principle



# (Data) Science

## scientific method

- possible to falsify
- hypothesis-driven
- statistical inference
- reproducibility


## p-value religion

> The [number of standard deviations] for which P = .05, or 1 in 20, is 1.96 or nearly 2; it is convenient to take this point as a limit in judging whether a deviation is to be considered significant or not.
(Roland Fisher)

Most people donâ€™t think of convenience as a serious criterion. Later in his career, Fisher actively advised against always using the same threshold for significance.

## reproducibility crisis

- data not available
- results difficult to verify
- the procedures vague
- ... and not clearly explained


# Open Science

## open science commitment

- preprints online: [arXiv.org](https://arxiv.org/)
- data and code available: [GitHub](https://github.com/)
    - e.g. [computationalstylistics repositories](https://github.com/computationalstylistics/)
- materials with DOI, e.g. on [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/)
- reproducible writing/coding
    - jupiter notebooks
    - RStudio
    - quarto
    - markdown


## FAIR principle

- Findability
    - each deposited file is described with rich metadata
    - the access is open and free
- Accessibility
    - metadata are accessible via open standards and protocols
    - metadata are accessible via open APIs
- Interoperability
    - use of commonly accepted file formats
    - use of identifiers: DOI, PMID, SWHid, arxivid
- Reusability
    - general terms of use, e.g. CC0 license


## reproducible data sources

- [European Literary Text Collection (ELTeC)](https://www.distant-reading.net/eltec/)
- [Drama Corpora Project (DraCor)](https://dracor.org/)
    - the notion of Programmable Corpora


## restrictive vs. permissive licenses

- Copyright -- all rights reserved
    - applicable up to 70 years after the author's death
- Public Domain -- use freely
    - expired Copyright automatically becomes Public Domain
- Creative Commons -- some rights reserved ðŸ‘ˆ
    - different variants of the license
    - the author can choose: CC BY, CC0, etc.
- General Public License -- open source code
    - the code can be copied, but needs to be released under GPL
    - see also: Apache License, BSD License, MIT License, etc.
